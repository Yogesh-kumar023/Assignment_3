                <h1 class="a1">Chicken</h1>
                <p class="p1">
                    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                     Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, 
                     chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                    Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, 
                    among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.
                     Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
                    
                    The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. 
                    In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more 
                    traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today,
                     making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

                <h1 class="a2">Beef</h1>
                 <p class="p2"> Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.
                Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.

                Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
                 short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), 
                 while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, 
                 on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
                  The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. 
                  Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). 
                  Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
                   The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

                <h1 class="a3">Sushi</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), 
                    stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the
                     fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of 
                     sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and
                      comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival
                       verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6]
                        Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.


                    Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
                    Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake
                     of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar 
                     significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. 
                    The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi 
                    or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
